# Pokemon Matchups

Pokemon Matchups is a site that that is aimed at people who have an intermediate knowledge of pokemon type matchups. This website aims to provide a fun and helpful way for user to test their pokemon knowledge.

Pokemon Matchups is ultimately a website where users can put what they have already learned about Pokemon to the test.

# Design

In this section I will cover the overall design choices of this project.

## Design goals

The overall goal with the design of this project is to make it instantly recognisable what this application is about, create an interface that is simple and easy to use, while also making it visually appealing to the user.

## Tools

This project was done entirely in JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3

## Layout

This project has aimed to have a clear layout. I have done this by using a logo and a large header that the user will instantly
be able to know what the the application is about. I have also included a brief introduction and instructions on how to get the game started

Inside the game area, the first thing you will see is two large buttons. Both of these buttons are clearly labeled so that the user can select which game they would like toplay. I have also stylised these with small images that represent the attack and defense nature of the games, as well as colour coded them in red and blue.

Underneath these buttons you will see the difficulty buttons, which all share one type of styling.

There is also the section for the user to input their name and a score area to keep track of right/wrong answers below the boxed off area with all the interactable sspactes of the UI.

In terms of font and styling, I decided to go with more jagged and blocking buttons and font elements as I felt that these were similar to that of old-school videogames.

All buttons also have a hover effect, and keep this effect when clicked to show the user what they have selected. Only one buttons of each type of button can be selected at a time, to the other clicked button will automaticall deselect.

When the user has entered either game, the opposing type will appear on the top of the game area. I had decided to put it here as they will not have to scroll to the bottom of the screen on smaller screen sizes. Under them, they will see the available types they can choose from, organised in rows of 4 on bigger screens, and decreasing on smaller screens.

## Colour Scheme

The colour scheme that I have used for this project is majority grey, red, blue, and black. I had decided on these colours to compliment the pokeball logo image I am using, as well as red and blue as pop colours to show the user that the areas using them are important and main feature of the application. I had also used some green and red on the scoring section, to represent positive and negative results.

# Features

In this section I will be covering the various features I have implemented. This application has 2 sepearte game mode, as well as 3 difficulty options, ultimately making a total combination of 6 game options. I have also implemented a feature that allows the user to enter their name before playing the game, which the game will use to give feedback to the user.

In the attack game, the user will see a type at the top of the game area. The user must then select what type of pokemon type is strong against this random one. If the user is correct an alert will pop down congratulating them. If they are incorrect, an alert will pop down telling them to try again. In both instances, the user is taken back to the interface to select a new game type, or select the same one if they so choose.

The defense game works very similar to this, as a type will appear at the top of the game area, but in this case they must choose a type that is weak against the random type. The alerts for this game are the same and they will be taken back to the selection screen after.

Depending on if their answers is correct or incorrect, the score will increment at the bottom of the screen. The score is visible at all time.

The difficulty will change some apsects of the game. In the easy difficulty, the user will only have 4 types to pick from, and also the random type they are against will only be one of those 4. In the medium difficulty this is increased to 6, and finally, in the hard difficulty this is increase again to 8.

# User Stories

- User Story 1: First impression of site functions.
- As a new user, I am a beginner to intermediate Pokemon player. I want to test my knowledge on this topic.

- User Story 2: Different buttons and their effects.
- As a user, I want to be able to clearly understand what each button on my screen does.

- User Story 3: Keeping track of progress.
- As a user, I want to be able to see how I am doing after each round, and see my grand total scores.

- User Story 4: Game flow.
- As a user, I want to understand what I have to do once I enter the game.

- User Story 5: What has been selected.
- As a user, I want to know what I have currently selected and which game I will be brought to before hitting play.

# Wireframes

Please see attached wireframes for the main page and game area. I have used desktop and mobile as my basis as large tablets appear like desktop and small tablets appear like mobile. The layout for attack and defense games are also identical, so they will both use the same wireframe.

# Logo, Header, and Intro

- The Logo and Header

- First thing a user see's. Designed to explain the functionality of the application and also make the subject matter very evident.
- This is shown both at the interface and while playing the game.

<img src="assets/images/interface-logo.png" alt="Photo of logo, header, and introduction">

# Game Area

- Box containing all the buttons needed to access the game.

- This was designed to clearly and easily show what each button does.
- Each button is supposed to show the user what they can expect by clicking it.
- All of this buttons have been put inside of a need box, so that the user knows they muxt complete all fields before being able to play.

<img src="assets/images/interface-gamearea.png" alt="Photo of the whole game area">

## Game Mode Buttons

- The first two buttons are the game mode buttons for the attack game and the defense game.
- They are both seperated by colour and can clearly be distinguished from one and other.
- They have been designed so that only one can be clicked at a time, and so that the system can read what game they would like to play correctly.

<img src="assets/images/interface-gamebuttons.png" alt="Photo of the game buttons">

## Difficulty Buttons

- These buttons are designed so the user can select which difficulty to play.
- They all have the same styling, and like the game mode buttons, only one can be selected at a time.

<img src="assets/images/difficulty-buttons.png" alt="Photo of the difficulty buttons">

## Username and Play Button

- This section is designed to that the user can enter their name, and then have that used for alerts at the end of the game.
- The play button will be clickable once all other buttons have been clicked. This will take you to whichever game is selected.

<img src="assets/images/play-button.png" alt="Photo of the play button and enter username section">

# Score Area

- This section is designed so the user can keep track of how they are doing in the game.

- This information will be displayed at all times.

<img src="assets/images/score-area.png" alt="Photo of the score area">

# Attack Game (Easy - Hard)

- The Attack Game

- This is one of the teo game modes that the user is able to play from.
- This game has been designed to be intuitive for the user to use. The random element is displayed at the top of the page and the player must then guess which type would be effective.
- The user must select the type which they think is strong against the random type.
- The options for the user are displayed horizontally in rows of 4, which will decrease as the screen gets smaller.
- The difficulty option selected by the user before entering this game will determine how many types they can pick from, and also how many types can be randomly generated.
- In easy mode, there will be 4 types all displayed horizontally.
- In medium mode, there will be 6 types on two rows, 4 on the first and 2 on the second.
- In hard mode, there will be 8 types on two roes, each displaying 4.
- There is also a short paragraph asking you the question of which type to pick.

<img src="assets/images/attack-game.png" alt="Photo of attack game area">

# Defense Game (Easy - Hard)

- The Defense Game

- This is the second game mode that the user is able to pick from.
- Visually very similar to the attack game, however the correct answer is different.
- This game has been designed to be intuitive for the user to use. The random element is displayed at the top of the page and the player must then guess which type would be effective.
- The user must select the type that they think is weak against the random type.
- The options for the user are displayed horizontally in rows of 4, which will decrease as the screen gets smaller.
- The difficulty option selected by the user before entering this game will determine how many types they can pick from, and also how many types can be randomly generated.
- In easy mode, there will be 4 types all displayed horizontally.
- In medium mode, there will be 6 types on two rows, 4 on the first and 2 on the second.
- In hard mode, there will be 8 types on two roes, each displaying 4.
- There is also a short paragraph asking you the question of which type to pick.

<img src="assets/images/defense-game.png" alt="Photo of defense game area">

# Alerts

- Alerts that are given at the end of each game to let the user know if they are right or wrong.

- This alerts will appear after the user has selected there answer.
- The alert will give a short congratulatory message or a message telling them to try another game.
- Omce these alerts are seen, the user is taken back to the interface and the score will increment.

<img src="assets/images/alert-image.png" alt="Photo of the alert image">

# Future Features

- There are a number of features that I have come up with that could be added at a later stage, I have not implemented them due to time constraints.
- There are a total of 18 different pokemon types, this is an obvious feature that I could include these in the game sections. My reason for not doing so is that this is geared more toward beginners and intermediate plays and did not want to overwhelm them.
- 3 round feature. I orifinally wanted the game to have a best of 3 feature but ultimately cut it out. My reason for tjhis is that the code began to have too many global variables and felt I need to cut it down.
- Timer feature for difficulty. This was a feature I was originally going to include with the 3 round system. Moving back to a single round, I felt the timer did not add much so removed it. I would like to implement this feature in the future however.

# Testing

- Ran html through W3C validator and Jigsaw css validator with no issues. HAve received some warnings and undefined variables on JSHint however upon examination needed these to function.

- I have checked screen compatibility for phone and tablet, I have checked tablet by using the inspect tool and shrinking down to size and have tested on my own personal mobile to assure it is responsive.

# Bugs

Throughout the project I had encountered several bugs which I will give details of in this section.

Resolved bugs:

- An issue I encountered was when when I was programming the defense game. When I entered the game the uer options were appearing, but not the random type. Upon investigation, I found that the user buttons were making the scores go up. This was due to my query selector using the same class to target my attack game image. I split these into IDs and then targeted those instead, and it was working as intended.
- Another issue I encountered was my defense game behaving the same as my attack game. Was unsure why and when I investigated I was calling the wrong array giving the same result. I changed my function to look for the weakness instead and worked perfectly.
- Another issue I has was with alerts. At the time I was attempting to implement a 3 eound system which did not make it to the end. When I clicked play my alerts whre appearing before the start of the game. I removed this feature and restructured my how my alerts were being called to resolve the issue.
- Another issue I had was correctly getting the username to appear. In the alert I kept getting the object or undefined. I realised this was being passed through the system incorrectly. I changed the variable name and this solved the issue.

Unresolved bugs:

- There are no unresolved bugs in the project to my knowing.
